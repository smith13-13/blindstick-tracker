# Blindman Stick Tracking Dashboard - Progress Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. System Architecture Design
We've designed a comprehensive architecture for the blindman stick tracking system with the following components:

- Smart Walking Stick with GPS and alert button
- Communication module for data transmission
- Cloud server for data processing and storage
- Dashboard application for visualization
- Notification system for home users

The architecture includes technology stack recommendations and a detailed data flow.

### 2. Dashboard UI Design
We've created a detailed specification for the dashboard UI including:

- Layout structure with map view, alert panel, and location history
- Component specifications for each UI element
- Color scheme and responsive design considerations
- Accessibility features for better usability
- Technical implementation notes

## Next Steps

To implement this system, we would proceed with:

1. Setting up the real-time location tracking system
2. Implementing the alert notification system
3. Creating the backend API for data handling
4. Developing the frontend dashboard with mapping functionality
5. Integrating the alert system with the dashboard
6. Testing all functionality
7. Optimizing performance and user experience

## Files Created

- `architecture.md` - Complete system architecture documentation
- `dashboard-ui-design.md` - Detailed dashboard UI specification
- `progress-summary.md` - This progress summary

## Implementation Plan

To start building the actual dashboard, we would need to switch to code mode and begin implementing the frontend components based on our design specifications.
